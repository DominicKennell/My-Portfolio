My Portfolio

I was instructed by the bootcamp to create a portfolio for my work as a way to showcase my abilities to future clients. 

For theis challenge I created all of the CSS from scratch and built most of the HTML from scratch. I have tried to transfer the knowledge I attained from my last challenge by trying to add semantic tags and ensuring the website is accessible as possible for those who may have trouble with their vision.

The navagation bar at the top will lead you to the relevant sections on the page.
